    I have been delivering IT Infrastructure for over two decades. I have worked

    including architecture, design, contractual development and negotiations. 


    I love to constantly learn, as I am passionate about technology and how it can improve our life. My other passions are sailing, running and spending time with my wife and two daughters.
